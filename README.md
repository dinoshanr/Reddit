Our Reddit project was built using HTML5, CSS, JS and Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework for developing responsive web and mobile projects.

Unsolved problems can be written after we complete the project


For planning documentation take pictures of the notes and notebook

There are no for installation dependencies because the bootstrap we used is being called by an api
