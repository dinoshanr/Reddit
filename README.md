1. Our Reddit project was built using HTML5, CSS, JS and Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework for developing responsive web and mobile projects.


2. We began our Reddit Clone by brain storming the layout. The layout started as a simple drawing on a white board. After few sketches of the layout we both agreed on the third one we sketched.

As the project progressed we asked pertinent questions including how many pages we planned to have, what colors are we going to use for the design, what frameworks can we use to build the clone and how are we going to incorporate the functionality into the design. Our initial discussions included ideas surrounding a multi page design but in order to have a better UI experience for the user we limited our project to a single webpage and. The single page design is responsive and user friendly which achieves a goal we of ours.

Since we decided to go with a  on a single page design we wanted to focus our time on the functionality of the API in conjunction with our site.

3. Unsolved issues that we faced:
  - Bringing in the user profile so we could see it and add the corresponding updates
  - Allowing the user to only view their posts/comments
  - Viewing/creating/deleting comments

6. How to use:
  - Sign up for Reddit
  - If you have already signed up, continue to login
  - Once you login you are able to submit a post using the create post feature.
